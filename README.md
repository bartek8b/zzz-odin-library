# zzz-odin-library

Project of virtual index of book, the part of The Odin Project.

## Challenges

- Responsive grid layout
<br>
Acomlished by use minmax() and grid-template rows set to 2, 1fr each & grid-auto-rows set to 1fr
<br><br>
- Make working buttons for toggle read status & delete book
<br>
Acomplished by nesting event listeners for NodeLists within displayLibrary() to make them refreshed after adding a book
<br><br>
- Make read status emojis look well adjusted to the rest of UI
<br>
I don't think I fully acomplished it, because unicode emojis looks diffrent on different devices and systems. Eventually I left it like it is because it's just a training project and don't want to waste my time on such unimportant thing.
